    <p>
      <strong>Fettucine Alfredo</strong> is an Italian pasta dish of fresh
      fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese. As the cheese melts, it
      emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the
      pasta. The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at
      his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of
      preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.
