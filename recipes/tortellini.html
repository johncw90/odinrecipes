    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Tortellini</strong> are pasta originally from the Italian region
      of Emilia (in particular Bologna and Modena). Traditionally they are
      stuffed with a mix of meat (pork loin, raw prosciutto, mortadella),
      Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, egg and nutmeg and served in capon broth (in
      brodo di cappone).
